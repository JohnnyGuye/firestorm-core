# FirestORM: the Firestore ORM

Firestorm is built around the official toolkit of firestore.

It is built around the decorator functionnality of typescript so whilst it probably can work in pure JS, it's not meant to.

# Documentations

You can find two websites with a full documentation at:
- [JSDoc](https://firestorm-doc.vercel.app/): Doc generated from the source code.
- [Showcase](https://firestorm-showcase.vercel.app/): Doc that actively uses firestORM so you can see it in action.
